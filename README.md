# Book Recommender 
  Final Project for the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Objective
Analysis of 10K books from a Goodreads Dataset, with the goal of clustering books and recommending books to users based on cluster and genre.

## Tools
   Python
   Machine Learning Models: k-means and DBSCAN Clustering Models
   Streamlit for app creation
   SQL for EDA
   Tableau for data visualisation


## Process:

  ## Data gathering
  
  ### Dataset
      The main dataset (books_enriched) comes from this repository:https://github.com/malcolmosh/goodbooks-10k-extended/tree/master 
      30,000 Books, 30 columns.
      I tried getting more data from Goodreads API and ISBN datase but it was not useful at the end.

  ## Data Cleaning

     - Droping unnecessaruy columns
     - Detecting missing values and duplicates
     - Utilizing different methods for dealing with NaNs for different columns
     - Transforming some columns based on their condition and distribution
     - Transforming categorical and numerical columns (One-hot encoding, Standard Scaler, MinMax Scaler)
     - Droping a few columns due to multicollinearity

  ## EDA
  
     - Python
     - SQL

 ## Visualisation

     - Tableau

 ## Clustering

   - Kmeans
   - DBSCAN
